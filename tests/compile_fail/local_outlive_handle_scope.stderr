  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |     |
  |     borrowed value does not live long enough
  |     binding `scope` declared here
...

  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::scope` which comes from the expansion of the macro `v8::scope` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
