// Copyright 2019-2021 the Deno authors. All rights reserved. MIT license.

//! This module's public API exports a number of 'scope' types.
//!
//! These types carry information about the state of the V8 Isolate, as well as
//! lifetimes for certain (return) values. More specialized scopes typically
//! deref to more generic scopes, and ultimately they all deref to `Isolate`.
//!
//! The scope types in the public API are all pointer wrappers, and they all
//! point at a heap-allocated struct `data::ScopeData`. `ScopeData` allocations
//! are never shared between scopes; each Handle/Context/CallbackScope gets
//! its own instance.
//!
//! Notes about the available scope types:
//! See also the tests at the end of this file.
//!
//! - `HandleScope<'s, ()>`
//!   - 's = lifetime of local handles created in this scope, and of the scope
//!     itself.
//!   - This type is returned when a HandleScope is constructed from a direct
//!     reference to an isolate (`&mut Isolate` or `&mut OwnedIsolate`).
//!   - A `Context` is _not_ available. Only certain types JavaScript values can
//!     be created: primitive values, templates, and instances of `Context`.
//!   - Derefs to `Isolate`.
//!
//! - `HandleScope<'s>`
//!   - 's = lifetime of local handles created in this scope, and of the scope
//!     itself.
//!   - A `Context` is available; any type of value can be created.
//!   - Derefs to `HandleScope<'s, ()>`
//!
//! - `ContextScope<'s, P>`
//!   - 's = lifetime of the scope itself.
//!   - A `Context` is available; any type of value can be created.
//!   - Derefs to `P`.
//!   - When constructed as the child of a `HandleScope<'a, ()>`, the returned
//!     type is `ContextScope<'s, HandleScope<'p>>`. In other words, the parent
//!     HandleScope gets an upgrade to indicate the availability of a `Context`.
//!   - When a new scope is constructed inside this type of scope, the
//!     `ContextScope` wrapper around `P` is erased first, which means that the
//!     child scope is set up as if it had been created with `P` as its parent.
//!
//! - `EscapableHandleScope<'s, 'e>`
//!   - 's = lifetime of local handles created in this scope, and of the scope
//!     itself.
//!   - 'e = lifetime of the HandleScope that will receive the local handle that
//!     is created by `EscapableHandleScope::escape()`.
//!   - A `Context` is available; any type of value can be created.
//!   - Derefs to `HandleScope<'s>`.
//!
//! - `TryCatch<'s, P>`
//!   - 's = lifetime of the TryCatch scope.
//!   - `P` is either a `HandleScope` or an `EscapableHandleScope`. This type
//!     also determines for how long the values returned by `TryCatch` methods
//!     `exception()`, `message()`, and `stack_trace()` are valid.
//!   - Derefs to `P`.
//!   - Creating a new scope inside the `TryCatch` block makes its methods
//!     inaccessible until the inner scope is dropped. However, the `TryCatch`
//!     object will nonetheless catch all exception thrown during its lifetime.
//!
//! - `CallbackScope<'s, ()>`
//!   - 's = lifetime of local handles created in this scope, and the value
//!     returned from the callback, and of the scope itself.
//!   - A `Context` is _not_ available. Only certain types JavaScript values can
//!     be created: primitive values, templates, and instances of `Context`.
//!   - Derefs to `HandleScope<'s, ()>`.
//!   - This scope type is only to be constructed inside embedder defined
//!     callbacks when these are called by V8.
//!   - When a scope is created inside, type is erased to `HandleScope<'s, ()>`.
//!
//! - `CallbackScope<'s>`
//!   - 's = lifetime of local handles created in this scope, and the value
//!     returned from the callback, and of the scope itself.
//!   - A `Context` is available; any type of value can be created.
//!   - Derefs to `HandleScope<'s>`.
//!   - This scope type is only to be constructed inside embedder defined
//!     callbacks when these are called by V8.
//!   - When a scope is created inside, type is erased to `HandleScope<'s>`.
